  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Ghana with strong interests in
    machine learning, medical imaging, biomedical device design, and applied healthcare technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic and project experience spans cancer image segmentation, CAD-based medical device
    design, telemedicine systems, and applied biomedical research. I enjoy translating engineering
    and computational ideas into practical solutions for real-world healthcare challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am currently undertaking my National Service at the Accra Psychiatric Hospital, where I am
    gaining exposure to clinical environments, healthcare systems, and biomedical equipment in a
    mental health setting. This experience is shaping my interest in technology-driven solutions
    for mental health care and clinical decision support.
  </p>

  <p>
    My long-term goal is to contribute to innovative research and development in biomedical
    engineering, particularly at the intersection of machine learning, medical imaging, and
    healthcare systems.
